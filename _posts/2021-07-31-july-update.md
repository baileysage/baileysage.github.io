## Biggest news! 

Getting married! JB proposed and we're getting hitched next year! Super happy and excited to sail through life together!

## Dog Update

Blackfeather is settling in well. Haven't gotten over the hookworm yet, though. Started new medication this month to keep combating them. ![Heart]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blackfeather_heart.JPG)


He got to hang out with other greyhounds and learned about pool life.

Made a jellyfish (and called it an octopus or squid.... more than once) for a friend's baby shower.
