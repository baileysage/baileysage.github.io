I have overworked my hands. By crocheting. By knitting. By typing, writing, holding my phone. I have trigger finger in my right hand and both are cramped up to the point where they're weak. It's hard for me to take a break and let them recover but also terrifies me that if I don't rest I may injure myself to the point of not being able to work at all. It's hard to balance the drive of getting things done with the need of taking care of myself.
