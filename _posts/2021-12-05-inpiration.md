Today I am collecting inspiration. 

I came across [this Walt Whitman quote rendered into a cravable poster by Ella Lama](https://www.ellalama.com/#/do-what-brings-joy/) and think it goes quite well with the Annie Dillard quote I've been wanting to make a sign of for quite some time now: "How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives." I like contemplating two or more quotes in conjunction. I feel like it provides a deeper understanding of one's interpretation of both. 

I saw a job posting for a digital fabrication position at an art center called Anderson Ranch. While the job itself is interesting, I wish there were places like this for people with an engineering or technician background to interact in a similar way. Or a sense that we'd belong at one of these art centers. Like many in this pandemic, I've been craving a deeper sense of community over the last couple of years. And I think I always have been looking to recreate the feelings of being surrounded by people who inspire and are all working on their own work together since I left college. I had started doing craft days at my house before the pandemic. I would like to start doing those again. Maybe an outdoors version next summer. 

"Nothing is a mistake. There’s no win and no fail, there’s only make." - From the [10 rules by Corita Kent](https://might-could.com/essays/10-rules-for-artists-by-sister-corita-kent/)

Been thinking a lot about the Buddhist idea that attachment to outcomes is one of the main sources of suffering. Reminding myself daily there is nothing "bad" happening even if things are not going as I expect or wish them to be going. 

Saw the local art center has classes starting late January. I would very much like to take one of the drawing classes. I feel like writing, drawing, and rest are the three core activities to making art and engineered objects. I feel like I could use dedicated practice at all of them!
