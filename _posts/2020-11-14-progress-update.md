In the spirit of "regularly", documenting progress made on projects today. And figuring out how to add images to the site! 

Picked up the first desk for my office and got it unpacked. It's really happening! Also bought some of the register covers I need for the office and bedrooms. And cable needles and thread at Joann while I was out and about. ;) 

Fixed a blanket I made for my mother last year. It was made in strips and a couple of my seams came out.

Said I wouldn't crochet, but I did a small number of flowers because I couldn't help myself.
