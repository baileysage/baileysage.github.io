Finished the amigurumi turtle to go with the as yet unfinished "beach blanket".

I wanted to try my hand at mosaic crochet after getting [The Mosaic Crochet Workshop](https://www.crochet.com/mosaic-crochet-workshop/p/33892) from the library and getting some mystery yarn, but I didn't want to use anyone else's pattern because they just didn't suit the light pink and blue of the yarn I got. So I made my own cloud pattern to be just as light and fluffy as the colors. And it's going on the pending shelf because I realized I'm already partway through two other afghans.

Rocked through fourteen granny squares in about a week to make a copy of our stockings for the kid sister. Now just to do the top band and assembly. So many ends to weave in. So many.
