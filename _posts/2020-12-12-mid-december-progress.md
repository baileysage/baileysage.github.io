## Crochet
Finished the shell scarf I'm giving a friend. Made a tunisian christmas tree ornament out of some scrap cotton yarn. The first stocking is done, the second needs seaming.

## Laser! 
Fired up the laser. Made the spirograph in the tutorial and made the first present for a co-worker. Ventilation needs to be improved, but the laser itself is working GREAT! 

## Office
Got the inside of the closet trim painted and got the shelves loaded and installed. Second desk is set up. Need to mountthe power bars and they should be "done". Need to get baseboards finished and finish the rest of the trim, but it feels like an office! 

## Electronics
Not much progress in this area. Got a few more controllers.... because of course. But nothing finished or moved forward this month. It's the holiday season and there's a pandemic on. So I'll let this one go.
