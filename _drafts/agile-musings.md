The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) is a document that has existed since I started working and it's been interesting to see it interpreted and re-interpreted through my career. I appreciate the simplicity of the four statements of the manifesto proper, and many of the 12 principles the original authors defined are pure gold and I wish I'd internalized some of them much earlier than I did. I've worked in agile, "agile", agile-lite, not-at-all agile, and so-agile-it's-just-chaos-now environments and I've been reflecting on those experiences in the context of the manifesto and the twelve principles. I was contemplating how fully each idea was practiced by the teams I've worked on through the years and what the effect of that adoption or lack thereof was on the team and my experience in it.

And for the most part, the more principles a team adopted, and the more fully they embraced them, the more pleasant and effective the working environment felt. Except one.

## Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely

I believe the intentions of this principle were sincere and well-meaning. Avoid "the crunch" before releases. Avoid being so busy and in a rush all the time. Make work feel more like a nice walk chatting with friends where you are so happily engaged you barely aware of the time passing and much less like desperate, top-speed running toward each milestone punctuated with gasping, chest-heaving 'breaks' that never feel long enough to truly recover before the next all-out effort has to begin.

But that's not how it's turned out for me or a lot of people I've worked with. There's a constant pace all right. But it's not a nice walk in the park, it was a death march. A slow one maybe, a slightly-less-than-full-crunch was a common experience. But either way, a death march. I heard over and over about "20 mile marches", no one thinking about the fact that Amundsen and his team was actually two teams, spent years preparing, didn't keep marching once they finished their trek to the South Pole, and probably slept a whole bunch on the boat ride to Australia. (You don't often hear about how they planned on and carried out butchering a good portion of the dogs along the way, too...) Their trip was not indefinite, and a constant daily pace was right for the context and duration of the mission.

Seasonality

What is the mission? Is it the same for everyone?

What is a "constant pace"? At what scale are we measuring?

## Cruft

### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

Who is the customer? Given "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation", I assume that most of the signatories thought of the customer as a contract client. So for most developers, this would be their employer. Not the end user or the buyer of that software. This has come up in my own work several times as my employer or client's wishes conflict or supercede those of the end user.
## Can we, pretty please?

Even in the most agile of environments, I don't think I experienced these principles to the fullest extent. Close, maybe, but never quite all the way there. I would love to work in a place where they are embodied!

### Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done

I love this statement, but it leaves a huge open ended question of "What is the environment and support needed?" And moreso, it hasn't ever been the priority of any of my employers. If it had been, we would have had more discussions about "what DO you need?" that weren't initiated by a mass grumbling that could be heard from thousands of miles away.

## Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential

Based on experience, this starts to _look_ like "waterfall development", and that scares the shit out of the agile people.

## At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

I have been on one team where this was a true priority, and it was a beautiful thing. Too bad we couldn't stand the sight of each other...
