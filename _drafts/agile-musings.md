The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) is a document that has existed since I started working and it's been interesting to see it interpreted and re-interpreted through my career. I appreciate the simplicity of the four statements of the manifesto proper, and many of the 12 principles the original authors defined are pure gold and I wish I'd internalized some of them much earlier than I did. I've worked in agile, "agile", agile-lite, not-at-all agile, and so-supposedly-agile-it's-just-chaos-now environments and I've been reflecting on those experiences in the context of the manifesto and the twelve principles. I was contemplating how fully each idea was practiced by the teams I've worked on through the years and what the effect of that adoption or lack thereof was on the team and my experience in it.

And for the most part, the more principles a team adopted, and the more fully they embraced them, the more pleasant and effective the working environment felt. Except one.

## Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely

I believe the intentions of this principle were sincere and well-meaning. Avoid "the crunch" before releases. Avoid being so busy and in a rush all the time. Make work feel more like a nice walk chatting with friends where you are so happily engaged you're barely aware of the time passing and much less like desperate, top-speed running toward each milestone punctuated with gasping, chest-heaving 'breaks' that never feel long enough to truly recover before the next all-out effort has to begin.

But that's not how it's turned out for me or the teams I've worked with, even the best ones. If there was a constant daily pace, there was also a constant level of daily stress.

I often hear about "20 mile marches" inspired by Amundsen's South Pole Expedition in relation to this Agile Principle. The idea is that Admunsen's team kept a constant pace on their successful journey to and return from the South Pole. 

But if we look at the entire mission to the South Pole, Amundsen and his team didn't just start walking. He spent years preparing and raising funds, and building a team before ever setting foot in Antarctica. Once they landed, they spent months going on practice treks to learn what they'd have to deal with, improve their equipment and plans in response, and lay in supplies at depots for use during the "real" trip. They set up a support base near their ship where they then spent entire winter preparing equipment for the journey, and adjusted their plans right up until the moment they set out. And then and only then, they kept a near-constant and challenging, but not entirely exhausing, pace, knowing it was going to be a difficult and risky trek. And when they finished it, they didn't keep marching. They darn near immediately climbed aboard their ship, only pausing to have dinner and load the bare minimum of their things. I'm guessing they probably slept for a large portion of the next few weeks while they sailed back to Hobart.

That daily pace was important for the context and duration (an expected 109 days) of the mission. That is the part I did not see translated to the teams I worked on. That "indefinitely" word at the end of the Agile Principle  And let's not forget that only 11 of the 52 dogs they set out with made it through the trip. At least 27 of them were butchered for food for the remaining dogs and the men, according to the plan.

Seasonality

What is the mission? Is it the same for everyone?

What is a "constant pace"? At what scale are we measuring?

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Cruft

### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

Who is the customer? Given "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation", I assume that most of the signatories thought of the customer as a contract client. So for most developers, this would be their employer. Not the end user or the buyer of that software. This has come up in my own work several times as my employer or client's wishes conflict or supercede those of the end user.

## Can we, pretty please?

Even in the most agile of environments, I don't think I experienced these principles to the fullest extent. Close, maybe, but never quite all the way there. I would love to work in a place where they are embodied!

### Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done

I love this statement, but it leaves a huge open ended question of "What is the environment and support needed?" And moreso, it hasn't ever been the priority of any of my employers. If it had been, we would have had more discussions about "what DO you need?" that weren't initiated by a mass grumbling that could be heard from thousands of miles away.

## Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential

Based on experience, this starts to _look_ like "waterfall development", and that scares the shit out of the agile people.

## At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

I have been on one team where this was a true priority, and it was a beautiful thing. Too bad we couldn't stand the sight of each other...
