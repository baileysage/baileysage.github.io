Having worked in agile, "agile", and decidedly not agile in any way environments, the Agile Manifesto is a document I keep returning to. While I can't argue with the four statements of the Manifesto proper, questions about a few of the 12 Principles keep resurfacing in my thoughts. Overall, I think the Manifesto and the Principals point to a better way of working than most of us are afforded, but the questions keep nagging at the back of my brain.

## I'm not sure I agree...

### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

Who is the customer? Given "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation", I assume that most of the signatories thought of the customer as a contract client. So for most developers, this would be their employer. Not the end user or the buyer of that software. This has come up in my own work several times as my employer or client's wishes conflict or supercede those of the end user.

## Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely

Humans... don't do this whole "constant pace" thing...

## Can we, pretty please?

Even in the most agile of environments, I don't think I experienced these principles to the fullest extent. Close, maybe, but never quite all the way there. I would love to work in a place where they are embodied!

### Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done

I love this statement, but it leaves a huge open ended question of "What is the environment and support needed?" And moreso, it hasn't ever been the priority of any of my employers. If it had been, we would have had more discussions about "what DO you need?" that weren't initiated by a mass grumbling that could be heard from thousands of miles away.

## Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential

Based on experience, this starts to _look_ like "waterfall development", and that scares the shit out of the agile people.

## At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

I have been on one team where this was a true priority, and it was a beautiful thing. Too bad we couldn't stand the sight of each other...
