title: Computational Crochet

---

As soon as I saw hyperbolic crochet, I was intrigued by the whole idea of math and engineering mixed with crochet. So I am doing some research and seeing what all is out there, as well as what I may explore on my own.

## Goals

First, satisfy my own curiosity. Second, compile what knowledge there is in one spot so I can refer back to it with my own experiments.

## Research

### Websites
- [Generative crochet website](https://www.generativecrochet.com/) and the author's [thesis](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/65955)
- [Crochet math](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/blog/wonders-mathematical-crochet/) intro to the topic

### Books
- [Hyperbolic Crochet](https://www.amazon.com/Crocheting-Adventures-Hyperbolic-Planes-Mathematics-dp-1138301159/dp/1138301159)
