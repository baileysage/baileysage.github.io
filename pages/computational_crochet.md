title: Computational Crochet

---

As soon as I saw hyperbolic crochet, I was intrigued by the whole idea of math and engineering mixed with crochet. So I am doing some research and seeing what all is out there, as well as what I may explore on my own.

## Goals

First, satisfy my own curiosity. Second, compile what knowledge there is in one spot so I can refer back to it with my own experiments.
