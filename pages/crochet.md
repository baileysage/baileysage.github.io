I've been trying to log my projects at [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/people/baileysage). Most pictures will go up there.

## Active Projects

# Hibernating 
- Kangaroos and Water Buffalos (everyone's got them, you know.)
- drawstring bag - bought pattern from TL Yarn crafts. Will use the corn fiber ribbon yarn for this.
- Tunisian corner to corner water color blanket - this was an excuse to buy the watercolor mandala yarn, really
- T-shirt yarn basket (Ran out of shirts... again.)

# Focus Projects
- Tunisian bobble scarf (or cowl if I'm bored when I run out of the first two skeins)
- Brick-look Tunisian scarf

# Crocheting done, needs finishing
- Tiny whale - needs eyes, sewing, and stuffing
- Tunisian hot pad sampler - needs ends woven in, folded in half and sewn together
- WiFi/Muscle Wire Octopus - needs arms sewn on after I figure out the muscle wiring
