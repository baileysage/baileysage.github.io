I've been trying to log my projects at [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/people/baileysage). Most pictures will go up there.

## Active Projects

# In Planning
- Brick-look Tunisian scarf
- Easter eggs (Collaborating with sister. She's embroidering them.)
- Wreath (For spring, not Christmas.)
- Tunisian corner to corner water color blanket
- Tiny cactus 

# Long term
- [Computational Crochet]({{ site.url }}/pages/computational_crochet.html)
- Beach ripple afghan
- T-shirt yarn basket (Ran out of shirts... again.)
- Kangaroos and Water Buffalos (everyone's got them, you know.)

# Focus Projects
- Tunisian bobble scarf (or cowl if I'm bored when I run out of the first two skeins)
- Flowers for giving away

# For Christmas
 (or at least, that's the plan anyway)
- Wool shell-stitch scarf
- Christmas stockings with fur cuffs

# Crocheting done, needs finishing
- Tiny whale - needs eyes, sewing, and stuffing
- Tunisian hot pad sampler - needs ends woven in, folded in half and sewn together
- WiFi/Muscle Wire Octopus - needs arms sewn on after I figure out the muscle wirei
